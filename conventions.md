Conventions
====

_todo: add more info_

JavaScript
----

* don't use ES6 `class`es (with exception to React components)
* if it makes sense as it's own module, make it into a module
* test that module

React
----

* export 1 component per file
* capitalize react component variables
* not terrible focused on testing react components at this moment

CSS & SCSS
----

* follow [trello css guides](https://gist.github.com/bobbygrace/9e961e8982f42eb91b80)
* only use `scss` for variables and mixins
* no nesting
* try to use neutron for grid layout
